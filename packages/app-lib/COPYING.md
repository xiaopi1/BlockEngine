The AI provider catalog and provider defaults are independently adapted from [LobeChat](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat) at commit `a27dfaeda1ab499ac024a6eb0448917b216ba8a1`. Bundled text-model metadata is synchronized from [LobeHub's model bank](https://github.com/lobehub/lobehub/tree/main/packages/model-bank/src/aiModels); the exact source revision is recorded in `src/api/lobehub_text_models.json`.

Provider protocol clients in this package are GPL-compatible implementations against the providers' documented wire formats; LobeHub-licensed application source is not incorporated into this GPL backend.
